I’m a Master’s student in Engineering Management at Texas A&M University, passionate about solving real-world challenges in supply chain, manufacturing, and business operations. I use data, AI tools, engineering strategies, and emerging technologies to optimize processes, reduce costs, and deliver measurable results.

With hands-on experience at Moderna, Skyworks Solutions, and Accenture, I’ve worked across biotech and semiconductor industry. I also bring a strong foundation in mechanical and automotive engineering from my undergraduate studies, where I led technical automotive projects and case studies, including participating in a Caterpillar case competition.

I’m continuously expanding my expertise in data analytics, supply chain systems, and manufacturing operations. I’m currently completing the MITx MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management to deepen my knowledge in global planning, strategy, and technology systems.
