# 👋 About Me

I’m a Master’s student in Engineering Management at **Texas A&M University**, passionate about solving real-world challenges in **supply chain**, **manufacturing**, and **business operations**. I use **data**, **AI tools**, **engineering strategies**, and **emerging technologies** to optimize processes, reduce costs, and deliver measurable results.

With hands-on experience at **Moderna**, **Skyworks Solutions**, and **Accenture**, I’ve worked across the **biotech** and **semiconductor** industries. I also bring a strong foundation in **mechanical** and **automotive engineering** from my undergraduate studies, where I led technical automotive projects and case studies — including a **Caterpillar case competition**.

I’m continuously expanding my expertise in **data analytics**, **supply chain systems**, and **manufacturing operations**. I’m currently completing the **MITx MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management** to deepen my knowledge in **global planning, strategy, and technology systems**.
